# CouchSurfing (clone)🏄🏨

**CouchSurfing** is a global hospitality exchange service accessible via a website and mobile app. Members can request lodging publicly or directly from other members, "hang out" with other members, or join/create events. Harassment is against the terms of service. Members set up user profiles on which other members can post reviews.

In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of **CouchSurfing**. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned so far in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with high precision and quality.

# Technology Stack Used 💻

In this project we have used the following tech stack.

- React <i class="devicon-react-plain colored"></i>

- CSS <i class="devicon-css3-plain colored"></i>
- Heroku (for api hosting) <i class="devicon-heroku-plain colored"></i>

Along with that, in order to store user data we also used LocalStorage (aka browser storage).
